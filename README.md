# LUX4

LUX4 is a powerful and fast communication protocol for Remote Procedure Call (RPC). The library provides both Client and Server classes. C/C++ porting is planned but for the Client side only. LUX4 performances are far ahead of other RPC protocol like RMI.

## Note
This project has concluded in December 2008. Unfortunately the history is lost (I'm trying to recover it) since the export from GoogleCode to Github failed.
